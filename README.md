## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Cutting-Edge Build** – Built from scratch with **the latest libraries and patterns**.
- **Visual Proof** – Demo video showcases **full CRUD functionality**.
- **Serverless & Global** – Deployable to **Vercel**, enabling a fully serverless backend.
- **QA-Driven** – Core paths fully tested to **prevent regressions**.
- **Future-Proof** – Modular design allows **easy extensions** and **feature integrations**.
